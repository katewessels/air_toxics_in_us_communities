# Air Toxics in US Communities
This project will explore the levels of PM 2.5 and Ozone concentration in the air in communities in the US, based on census tract and block group.  This project will also explore the measured lifetime cancer risk and respiratory hazard index in these same US communities.

Quesitons I'd like to Explore:
- How do PM 2.5 and ozone concentration levels in the air vary in different communities in the US? How is this correlated to the percentage of minority and low income residents in a community? 
- How does the respiratority hazard and cancer risk due to toxic air pollutants vary in different communities in the US? In what ways are low income and minority communities at greater risk to cancer and respiratory diseases in the US due to air pollution?
